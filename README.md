# 3D_software_rasterization
I'm new in graphics programming and I want to know how all works under the hood. I think it is a good approach learn from bottom-to-up. In this project I will not use any math libraries not because they are bad, but because how I said early I want to understand how all works under the hood.
# Done
* Basic triangle rasterization algorithm
* My own little obj model loader
